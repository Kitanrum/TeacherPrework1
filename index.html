            <p>Picky Pocket’s Quest for Greatness is a stealth game about a young thief, Picky Pocket, with the desire to become a legendary thief. Picky is a fledgling pickpocket raised by a kind Old Lady. The Old Lady would tell Picky stories of the great Cut Lass, a pirate turned thief who had mysteriously disappeared long before Picky was born. As the story goes, Cut Lass had chosen to steal the fabled Tarnhelm / Ring of Gyges, an item capable of rendering the user invisible at will. The night of the heist came and went: the artifact remained on display and Cut Lass was never seen again. Fueled by the stories, Picky has chosen to complete the heist in order to become the greatest thief of all time.</p>
            <p>Picky will have several abilities that make sneaking and stealing a cinch. Each level will showcase one item of increasing value, the Big Score. The aim will be to steal the Big Score to raise Picky’s infamy level. Big Score’s are protected by varying types of surveillance systems and guards. Choosing the path of a “noble” thief, Picky does not engage in combat with guards and must rely on pure skill to remain undetected.</p>
