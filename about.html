            <p>Extravagantville is made up of five districts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lowborn Town, the poorest district of Extravagantville and where Picky has grown up</li>
                <li>Garden Variety Center, the hot bed of manufacturing. Thatâ€™s it. Nothing really happens in this part of town</li>
                <li>Diligence District, inhabited by the hardest workers. Without these middle class denizens, every district in Extravagantville would grind to a halt</li>
                <li>Toity Town, home to the nouveau riche and the wealthy entrepreneurs</li>
                <li>Avari City, home to the Babylon Corporations Headquarters.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Picky Pocket is a young pickpocket who was orphaned at a young age and raised by the Kind Old Lady. Despite growing up in Lowborn Town, Picky still exhibits a childlike wonder about most things. With such willpower and determination, Picky will do whatever it takes to become a legendary thief!</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Kind Old Lady isn't like most of the people in Lowborn Town. Although her clothes maybe tattered and worn, she exudes classyness. Some people say she might be a lost heiress, but Picky just knows her as the best storyteller and caregiver to ever be.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id ="TOT">The Old Tinkerer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Kind Old Lady's older brother, the Old Tinkerer is an inventory always cooking up new tools for Picky to use while off on an adventure. He's the smartest person in Lowborn Town, capable of creating machines and spells.</li>
